        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID Method specification</a>
defines the precise operations by which
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#abstract">Decentralized Identifiers</a>
(DIDs) and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#core-properties">DID documents</a> are
created, resolved, updated, and deactivated. Since the publication of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/">DID Core v1.0
specification</a>, many DID Methods have been created and deployed.
As national governments and large corporations continue to adopt this
technology, it is beneficial for those organizations to have standardized,
production-grade DID Methods to deploy. While DID Methods can be standardized
in any standards-development organization, there are a few that utilize the
architecture of the Web, and Web technologies, and would benefit
standardization at W3C.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
The scope of the initial DID Methods Working Group will be to standardize
one Web-based DID Method and one ephemeral DID Method, and to coordinate
with the DID Working Group to include recommendation of one fallback,
mandatory-to-implement DID Method.
        </p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>
In order to advance to
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed
Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is
expected to have
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at
least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined
in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open
test suites.
    </p>
    <p>
There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest
drafts.
    </p>
    <p>
To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications in Candidate
Recommendation or to features that have deployed implementations should have
<a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a> through the
Working Group managed test suite.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>
Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
    </p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>
This Working Group expects to follow the TAG
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">
Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>

  </section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>
For all specifications, this Working Group will seek
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">
horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and
security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture
Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major
standards-track document transition, including
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public
Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage
collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each
specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months
before first entering
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate
Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal
review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
        </p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active
participants for its duration, including representatives from the key
implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each
specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to
contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no
minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists
and document repositories, as described in
<a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for
consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Participants in the group are required (by the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">
W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.

      <section id="communication">
        <h2>
          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>:
the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be
archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be
conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general
public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed
in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues,
actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/dm/">Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
Most Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular
specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list
<a id="dmwg" href="mailto:public-dmwg@w3.org">public-dmwg@w3.org</a>
(<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dmwg/">archive</a>) or on
each specification's Github repository. The public is invited to review, discuss
and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes
and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only
discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process
Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other
participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little
formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not
achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs
may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution
(including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or
teleconference will be considered provisional.

A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of one week one
week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
consensus on the issue.

If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution
will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until
new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the
Chairs.

This charter is written in accordance with the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">

voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
